## What areas of the app did you focus on?

I focused on all areas of the app, starting with understanding how the application should work. I began by planning and sketching the solution before implementing it.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

I believe in solving problems by thinking and planning first. My main goal was to reduce errors and avoid wasting time by having a clear understanding of the solution before starting to code.

## How long did you spend on this project?

Approximately 12 hours, including time spent studying relevant concepts.

Yes. With more time, I would have improved the layout, added more features, and refined the overall UI/UX design.
